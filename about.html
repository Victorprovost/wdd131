            <div class="history">
                <p>
                    The Institute of Religion program of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints began in 1926 at the
                    University of Idaho, Moscow. It was established to provide religious education and spiritual support for Latter-day
                    Saint students attending colleges and universities. Initially, the program aimed to supplement students' secular
                    education with gospel teachings and to create a community of faith among young adults.
                    
                    Throughout the 20th century, the Institute program expanded significantly, with Institutes being established near major
                    universities across the United States and later internationally. These Institutes offer classes on scripture, Church
                    history, and other gospel topics, providing a place for students to deepen their understanding of the faith and to
                    connect with peers who share their beliefs.
                    
                    Institutes of Religion are often located near campuses, allowing easy access for students. They function under the
                    Church Educational System (CES) and serve as a complement to the Church's seminary program, which focuses on high school
                    students. Institutes also offer various social, cultural, and service activities, helping students to develop
                    spiritually, socially, and academically.
                    
                    Today, the Institute of Religion program continues to play a vital role in the lives of Latter-day Saint young adults,
                    providing education, community, and spiritual enrichment to help them navigate the challenges of higher education and
                    young adulthood.
